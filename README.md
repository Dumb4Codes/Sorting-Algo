## Sorting Algorithms and Time Complexities

1. **Bubble Sort**
    - Time Complexity: O(n^2)
    - Bubble Sort repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. This process continues until the list is sorted.

2. **Selection Sort**
    - Time Complexity: O(n^2)
    - Selection Sort sorts an array by repeatedly finding the minimum element from the unsorted part and moving it to the beginning.

3. **Insertion Sort**
    - Time Complexity: O(n^2)
    - Insertion Sort builds a sorted array one element at a time. It takes each element and inserts it into its correct position in the already sorted part of the array.

4. **Merge Sort**
    - Time Complexity: O(n log n)
    - Merge Sort divides the array into two halves, sorts each half, and then merges them back together. It uses a divide-and-conquer approach.

5. **Quick Sort**
    - Time Complexity: O(n log n) (average case)
    - Quick Sort chooses a "pivot" element and partitions the array into two sub-arrays: elements less than the pivot and elements greater than the pivot. It then recursively sorts the sub-arrays.

6. **Recursive Bubble Sort**
    - Time Complexity: O(n^2)
    - Recursive Bubble Sort is a recursive implementation of the Bubble Sort algorithm, making it less efficient than the iterative version.

7. **Recursive Insertion Sort**
    - Time Complexity: O(n^2)
    - Recursive Insertion Sort is a recursive implementation of the Insertion Sort algorithm, inserting elements into the already sorted sub-array.

## Usage
